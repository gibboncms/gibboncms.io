# Introduction

GibbonCms is a project made as my final assignment for my education as a web developer at [Artevelde University College Ghent](http://arteveldehogeschool.be/bachelor-de-grafische-en-digitale-media/afstudeerrichtingen#ProDEV).

## Modular

Gibbon exists of a required core package, and a set of modules, so you only need to install what you need. Gibbon is also compatible with any existing PHP-project, no need to start from the ground up.

## Flat files

Flat files are easier to read and edit than databases for people, which makes them ideal for managing content on a small to medium-sized website.

## Architecture

Gibbon's code is fully PSR-compliant, and tries to respect the SOLID principles as much as possible. The core and all modules also have full test coverage with phpunit.

Gibbon's source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/gibboncms), and all packages are published on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/gibboncms/).
